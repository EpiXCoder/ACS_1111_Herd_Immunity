	SIMULATION SUMMARY:
		✺ The simulation ended with 7094 survivors, 2990 infected individuals and 2906 fatalities.
		✺ The simulation ended because everyone in the population were either immune or dead.
		✺ In total, 640800 interactions were simulated. Of which, 448459 interactions were condusive to immunity acquisition and 7431 interactions were potentially infectious.
