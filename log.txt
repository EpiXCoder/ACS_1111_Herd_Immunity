	SIMULATION SUMMARY
		 The simulation ended with 7086 survivors (of whom 7086 are now vaccinated) and 2914 fatalities. The simulation ended because everyone in the population were either immune or dead.
		 In total, 621800 interactions were simulated. Of which, 435256 interactions were conducive to immunity acquisition and 7469 interactions were potentially infectious.
