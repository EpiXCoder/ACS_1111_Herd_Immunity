	SIMULATION SUMMARY
		 The simulation ended with 7111 survivors (of whom 7111 are now vaccinated) and 2889 fatalities. The simulation ended because everyone in the population were either immune or dead.
		 In total, 633000 interactions were simulated. Of which, 442935 interactions resulted in immunity acquisition and 7327 interactions were potentially infectious.
