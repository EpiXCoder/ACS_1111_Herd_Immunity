	SIMULATION SUMMARY:
		✺ The simulation ended with 7114 survivors (of whom 7114 are now vaccinated) and 2886 fatalities.
		✺ The simulation ended because everyone in the population were either immune or dead.
		✺ In total, 620800 interactions were simulated. Of which, 433555 interactions were conducive to immunity acquisition and 7495 interactions were potentially infectious.
