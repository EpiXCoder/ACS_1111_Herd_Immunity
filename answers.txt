# What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
    Population Size: 10000
    Vaccination Percentage: 0.7
    Virus: Ebola
    Mortality Rate: 0.7
    Reproduction Number: 0.25

# What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
    Aside from the 10 initially infected individuals, 2990 (29.9% of the vulnerable population) persons became infected.

What percentage of the population died from the virus?
    29.13% died from the virus


Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
    out of 629700 interactions, vaccination saved someone from potentially becoming infected 441127 times.
